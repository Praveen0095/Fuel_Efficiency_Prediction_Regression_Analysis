## Introduction

The Mileage Prediction project aims to build a predictive model to estimate the fuel efficiency of vehicles based on various features such as engine size, weight, horsepower, and more. This can help in understanding factors affecting vehicle mileage and making informed decisions for better fuel economy.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Visualization of results

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Auto MPG dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information on various technical aspects of cars, including:
- MPG (Miles per Gallon)
- Cylinders
- Displacement
- Horsepower
- Weight
- Acceleration
- Model Year
- Origin

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mileage-prediction.git
   cd mileage-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scriptsctivate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
